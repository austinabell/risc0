[dependencies]
# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. This is great for development, but requires
# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so it's only enabled
# in debug mode.

# The `wasm-bindgen` crate provides the bare minimum functionality needed
# to interact with JavaScript.

# The `web-sys` crate allows you to interact with the various browser APIs,
# like the DOM.
web-sys = { version = "0.3", features = ["console"] }

# `wee_alloc` is a tiny allocator for wasm that is only ~1K in code size
# compared to the default allocator's ~10K. However, it is slower than the default
# allocator, so it's not enabled by default.

# These crates are used for running unit tests.
